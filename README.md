## Overview

This library provides direct, low-level USB communication with the Native Instruments Maschine MK3, bypassing Native Instruments' software. It handles:

- **Input Events**: Buttons, pads (with velocity), knobs, and touch strip
- **LED Control**: Individual button and pad LEDs with full color support
- **Display Graphics**: 480x272 RGB565 display output
- **Real-time Performance**: Optimized for low-latency audio applications

## ⚠️ Project Status

**Alpha Software** - This library is in early development. APIs may change, and some features are incomplete. Use at your own risk.

## Requirements

### Hardware

- Native Instruments Maschine MK3 controller

### Platform Support

- **Windows**: Only supported platform (requires Windows 10 or later)

### Driver Setup (Windows)

**Important**: You must replace the Native Instruments USB driver with a generic WinUSB driver:

1. **Stop Native Instruments services**:

   ```
   net stop "Native Instruments Background Task Server"
   net stop "Native Instruments Shared Device Service"
   ```

2. **Install WinUSB driver** using [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/):

   - Download and run Zadig as Administrator
   - Select "Options" → "List All Devices"
   - Find "Maschine MK3" in the dropdown
   - Select "WinUSB" driver and click "Replace Driver"

3. **Verify installation**: The device should appear in Device Manager under "Universal Serial Bus devices"

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
maschine-mk3 = "0.1"
```

## Quick Start

```rust
use maschine_mk3::{MaschineMK3, MaschineLEDColor, InputEvent};
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Connect to the device
    let mut device = MaschineMK3::new()?;
    println!("Connected: {}", device.device_info()?);

    // Monitor input events
    loop {
        let events = device.poll_input_events()?;
        for event in events {
            println!("{}", event.description());

            // Light up pads when hit
            if let InputEvent::PadHit { pad_number, .. } = event {
                device.set_pad_led(pad_number, MaschineLEDColor::red(true))?;
            }
        }

        std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(10));
    }
}
```

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains various demonstration programs:

- **`simple_test.rs`** - Basic connectivity, input monitoring, and LED control
- **`input_monitor.rs`** - Real-time input event monitoring
- **`color_test.rs`** - Display color patterns and graphics
- **`led_animation.rs`** - LED animation patterns
- **`reactive_leds.rs`** - Reactive LED responses to input

Run an example:

```bash
cargo run --example simple_test
```

## Features

### Input System

- **Buttons**: All transport, group, and function buttons with press/release events
- **Pads**: 16 velocity-sensitive pads (0-127) with pressure detection
- **Knobs**: 8 rotary encoders with delta tracking
- **Touch Strip**: Continuous position and pressure sensing
- **Change Tracking**: Only reports actual state changes, not redundant data

### LED Control

```rust
// Individual LED control
device.set_button_led(InputElement::Play, 127)?;
device.set_pad_led(0, MaschineLEDColor::red(true))?;

// Bulk operations
device.clear_all_leds()?;
```

### Display Graphics

- **Resolution**: 480x272 pixels
- **Format**: RGB565 color space
- **Performance**: Direct USB bulk transfers for minimal latency

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **`MaschineMK3`** - Main device interface and connection management
- **Input System** - HID report parsing with state tracking and change detection
- **Output System** - LED state management and display graphics
- **USB Communication** - Cross-platform USB handling with Windows HID fallback

### USB Protocol

- **Vendor ID**: 0x17CC (Native Instruments)
- **Product ID**: 0x1600 (Maschine MK3)
- **HID Interface**: #4 (Input/Output endpoint pair)
- **Display Interface**: #5 (Bulk transfer for graphics)

## Development

### Building

```bash
# Development build
cargo build

# Optimized build
cargo build --release

# Run tests
